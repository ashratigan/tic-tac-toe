# Tic Tac Toe Project

## Overview
This Tic Tac Toe game was my first project for General Assembly's Web Development Immersive. The purpose of the project was to create a Single Page Application that would allow two people to play tic tac toe. 

My user stories were:
- As a user, I can make an account
- As a user, I can sign in to my account
- As a signed-in user, I can sign out
- As a signed-in user, I can play a game
- As a signed-in user, I can track scores
- As a signed-in user, I can reset the game
- As a signed-in user, I can reset my password
- As a signed-in user, I can view my game history

Some of the project requirements were:
- make frequent, useful commits
- use jQuery for DOM manipulation and AJAX for interacting with the provided API
- build a webpage from scratch
- deploy to Github pages

## Technologies used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Bootstrap
- JavaScript
- jQuery
- Google Fonts

The basic structure was built with HTML5, styling was done with CSS and Bootstrap. Game logic was built with JavaScript and was used to send AJAX calls. JQuery was also used to interact with the DOM. 

## Features and Additions
In addition to the requirements for this project, I tried to add some unique features. 

- I styled the game to have a night sky theme. 
- Instead of traditional X and O, I used ðŸŒ› and ðŸŒž to stay with my theme.
- I included a message to notify which player's turn is next. 
- I added a button to reset the score. 
- I added different gifs to be displayed based on which player wins and if there is a tie.
### Recently added features ###
- I added a new feature to allow users to choose their playing piece from a dropdown menu of emojis.
